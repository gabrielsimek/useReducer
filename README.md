# useReducer

Refactor the hook to `useReducer` instead of `useState`. Refactor only the hook, you
shouldn't need to refactor the component at all.

- behavior test 3 pts

```
// get color input
// fire change event on color input with newColor
// expect display to have backgroundColor === newColor

// get undo button
// fire click event on undo button
// expect display to have backgroundColor === red

// get redo button
// fire click event on redo button
// expect display to have backgroundColor === newColor
```
